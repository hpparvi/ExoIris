Overview
--------

**ExoIris** is a user-friendly Python package designed to simplify and accelerate the analysis of transmission
spectroscopy data for exoplanets. The package can estimate a self-consistent medium-resolution transmission spectrum
with uncertainties from JWST NIRISS data in a matter of minutes, even when using a Gaussian Process-based noise model.

ExoIris uses PyTransit's `TSModel`, a transit model that is specially optimised for transmission spectroscopy and allows
for simultaneous modelling of hundreds to thousands of spectroscopic light curves 20-30 times faster than when using
standard transit models not explicitly designed for transmission spectroscopy.

A complete posterior solution for a low-resolution transmission spectrum with a data resolution of R=100
takes 3-5 minutes to estimate assuming white noise, or 5-15 minutes if using a Gaussian process-based likelihood
model powered by the celerite2 package. A high-resolution spectrum of the JWST NIRISS WASP-39 b observations
by `Feinstein et al. (2023) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023Natur.614..670F/abstract>`_ with ~3800
spectroscopic light curves (as shown above) takes about 1.5 hours to optimise and sample on a three-year-old
AMD Ryzen 7 5800X with eight cores.
